## What is Seaborn?

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides beautiful and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is designed to work with Pandas data frames and to make visualizations of complex data easier and more attractive. The following website is also a great resource for learning how to create visualizations in Seaborn: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html.

## Getting started with Seaborn

The first step is to install Seaborn. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

**pip-install-seaborn

Next, you will need to import Seaborn into your Python environment. You can do this by using the following code:

**import-seaborn-as-sns

## Loading data into Seaborn

The following code will allow you access to the iris dataset, which is a data frame with 150 measurements of iris petal widths and lengths of three different species.
