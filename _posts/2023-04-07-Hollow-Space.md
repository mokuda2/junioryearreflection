## Section 1

August 29, 2022.  I couldn’t believe it was the start of another semester.

Gyuna texted about half an hour before our CS 180 class saying that she was sitting near the front of the classroom.  The classroom was in the basement of the JFSB, which was a complete maze to me.  I walked around, trying to find the room number.  Suddenly, I felt someone pull the handle of my backpack.

“Hey.”  It was Gyuna.

“Oh, hey,” I greeted, a bit surprised.  “Where’s the classroom?”

“You passed it.  It’s over here.”  She guided me to the room while she continued to pull on the handle of my backpack.

After class, we walked up the stairs outside the JFSB that led to the ground floor.  “What are you going to do?” Gyuna asked.

“I’m thinking about going to the gym to exercise,” I answered.  “I’m gonna do better about exercising this semester.”

“Where’s the gym?  I think I’ll tag along just to see what it’s like.  I’ve got my next class in about an hour.”

“You’ll have to get a wristband in order to use their gym.  I’ll show you.”

After she got her wristband, we went to the Smith Fieldhouse where the gym was.  “Wow, it’s tiny!” she said.  “Much smaller than BYU-Idaho’s gym.”

“Yeah, but at least it’s free.”

“I might end up going to VASA instead.  There are so many people here.  It’s too crowded.”

After some exploring, Gyuna left to go to class.  But what was surprising was that on Wednesday, she tagged along after class as well.

“Are you going to exercise?” she asked.

“I did this morning,” I answered.  “I’ve found that it’s not as crowded in the mornings than the afternoons.  I plan on studying at the library.”

“Okay, I’ll follow you since I don’t know where anything is yet.”

We went to the second floor of the library where I usually studied during my freshman year.

“What do you think of these pictures?” Gyuna asked me after a few minutes of settling down in some seats.  “I’m thinking about posting them on my Instagram.”

“I know where that is,” I said as she showed me a picture of her at the stairs of the Wilk.

“Oh shoot, I forgot my phone charger.  Do you happen to have the one I need?”

“I don’t think so.”

She then asked a girl who was sitting on the other side of me.  I was surprised how outgoing Gyuna was to talk to someone she didn’t know like that.  “...Yeah, this is my first semester at BYU, and it’s been a lot.  But thanks so much!”

After a bit of studying, I saw that she was about to take a selfie with me.

“Wait, you’re posting that on your story?” I asked after she took one.

“Yeah.”

“Frick, that wasn’t a good picture of me.  Take another one.”

So she did and posted it on her story.

And then on Friday after class...

“Hey, I’m going to sing some karaoke right now,” Gyuna said.  “Wanna join?”

I was thinking about studying for the rest of the day and then shopping afterwards.  Honestly, I was a bit nervous when she tagged along with me to the gym and the library on Monday and Wednesday.  It was... weird to have someone hang out with me.  But maybe I needed to give her a chance.  “Sure,” I said.  I didn’t think it would be too long.  “Where are you going to go karaoke?”

“I reserved a room in the library.”

“I didn’t know they had karaoke rooms.  Who all is going with you?”

“I was going to do it by myself,” she said.

“By yourself?”

“You’ve never heard of solo karaoke?  They do it all the time in Korea.”

Gyuna and I went to the fourth floor of the library.  There was a studio area, and we went into a room with a bunch of audio equipment in it.  “What do you want to sing?” she asked as she set stuff up.

“Uh, I don’t know,” I answered.  “I don’t really know that many songs.”  I had to think for a moment.  “Hm... I know!  ‘Ddu du ddu du.’”

Gyuna laughed.  “‘Ddu du ddu du’!  That was your song on the mission.”

So I sang “ddu du ddu du.”  One of Gyuna’s friends found us, and I ended up doing a “Let It Go” duet with him.  After some songs, we went shopping together at Smith’s.  I actually had fun.  It had been a while since I had done something so social.

...

September 9, 2022.  Christian came down from Rexburg and spent a few days with Gyuna.  It was my second time seeing Christian in person.  Gyuna said she video chatted with him every day.

After Gyuna and I were finished with our CS 180 class, she and I went to the Talmage building where Christian was hanging out.  The three of us decided to go to a restaurant right outside of campus.  I wasn’t expecting to hang out with them, as I was thinking I’d do homework in the West View Building—the stats building.  But I didn’t mind tagging along, especially since Christian actually talked to me.  I felt like most dating relationships didn’t like it when other people were around.

“So, Michael, what are your hobbies?” Christian asked when the three of us were settled down with our food.

Hobbies?  Did I actually have any?  “Hm...” I had to think.  “I don’t do much these days that I’d consider hobbies.  Maybe working out.  It’s a good stress reliever.”

“If you didn’t have school or work or anything like that to worry about, what would you do?”

That was basically my life: school, work, sleep, repeat.  I didn’t know what I would do.  “I mean, growing up, I played the piano.  And tennis is my sport.”

“He’s REALLY good at the piano!” Gyuna said.  “On the mission, he’d be like, ‘I can play some piano.’  Yeah, he can play!  You’ll have to hear him sometime.”

“What kind of music do you listen to?” Christian asked.

“I don’t listen to music that often,” I answered.  “But I played classical music growing up.”

“What about when you exercise?  Do you listen to music?”

“Yeah.  It’s usually K-pop or some J-pop.  Mostly K-pop and random soundtracks from video games.”

“I didn’t know you listened to J-pop,” Gyuna said.  “What artists do you listen to?”

“Do you know AKB48?” I asked.

“Oh yeah, they’re the ones who are like...”  Gyuna made some sort of Japanese imitation.

“Yeah.  Exactly like that,” I said sarcastically.  “And Babymetal.  I listen to some.”

“What about relationships?  Have you ever been in a relationship?” Christian asked.

“No,” I answered.

“Really?  You’re missing out.”

I didn’t know what he meant by that.  Life was just fine without a relationship.

“Any celebrity crushes you’ve had?” he asked.

“No, I don’t really know celebrities.”  It was kind of true.  I didn’t khave any celebrity “crushes.”  I honestly didn’t know what that meant.  Someone I obsessively thought about?  No, I didn’t have that kind of Disease.

Gyuna and Christian kind of gave each other a look like I did or said something wrong.  “You know _Howl’s Moving Castle_, right?” Gyuna asked.  “Would you date Sophie?”

“No,” I answered.  I didn’t get why I would want to date an animated character.

“What about Howl?”

“Uh.  No.”

Gyuna and Christian gave each other another look.

“He’s just going to need to find a really pretty girl,” Christian said.  “Then he’ll know what it’s like to be in love.”

“Yeah, and you’ll know what it’s like to like being touched,” Gyuna said.  For the past few days, she liked to pinch the tip of my elbow.  I thought it was weird.  She said that physical touch was her love language, but that kind of touch?  It didn’t feel natural or loving to me.

After we finished eating, we went back to campus to work on homework, and we chatted some more.  So far, the labs for CS 180 weren’t terribly difficult, but I knew Gyuna was struggling a bit, so I also took time to help her with the concepts.

“Why isn’t it working?” she asked after she ran the code.

“What does the error say?” I asked.  “Looks like one of your variables isn’t defined.”

“Oh.”  She took time to fix it and then ran it again.  It outputted something, but it didn’t output what it was supposed to.

“Tell me what your for loop is doing,” I said.  “Take me through each line of code.”

So she did, and she seemed to figure things out after I explained what was going on.  “Wow, you’re so smart,” she said.  She tried to pinch my elbow again, but I naturally evaded it.  “Dang it.”

“You’re not going to touch me like that.”

“Can I hug you?  Or maybe KISS you?”  Gyuna asked as she puckered her lips.

“No.”

“Can _I_ kiss you?” Christian asked as he puckered his lips.

“Uh, no.”

“Bro, physical touch is my love language,” Gyuna said.  “So where can I touch you?”

“Maybe my shoulder.”

“Oh okay,” she said as she proceeded to rub my shoulder.

“Okay, not like that.”

On another day, Gyuna and I went to the library to study together again.  She didn’t like studying on the second floor for some reason, so we went to the fourth floor and wandered around.  “Oh, look at that!” she said as she pointed at some sort of medieval armor.  We walked closer to it.  “It’s samurai armor, your ancestors.”  After staring at it for some time, she looked like she was going to break down.

“What happened?” I asked.

“I felt like my ancestors were calling for me.  The Japanese killed my ancestors and did some pretty cruel things.”

I had heard about Korea and Japan not having the greatest relationship with each other, but I didn’t know anything about the history.  So Gyuna explained a bit about it.  She also talked about some sort of political issue about this one island between Japan and South Korea that Japan owned, even though she claimed that it was Korea’s territory from history.  I guess it was an issue because lots of resources were around and under that island.  I didn’t get why it was such a big deal.  It wasn’t going to matter at all after we died.

“I do love Japanese people,” Gyuna said.  “I’ve met some great Japanese people and have even made friends at the MTC with them.  But the Japanese history and even their government these days... Not as much.  I probably wouldn’t be telling you all of this if you were actually from Japan, but you always tell people that you’re from uh... Kentucky.”

...

I had been applying to several internships, and unlike last school year, I was getting a surprising number of responses that weren’t rejection letters.  I had done video interviews for Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, KPMG, and others and averaged about three interviews a week in September.  It was a lot of interviews, but I felt more confident in my interviewing skills, especially behavioral interviews.

As far as apartment life, I wasn’t at my apartment that often since I didn’t like being there during the daytime, but it seemed like most of my roommates liked studying in the apartment.  I didn’t feel connected to my roommates, at least not as much as I felt like they connected with each other.  Sure, I wasn’t at the apartment as often, but even when I was there, they didn’t really talk to me.  Oh well.  At least what I liked about my roommates was that they kept the place fairly clean, and they went to bed early.  It helped me go to bed early too.

...

September 23, 2022.  It was Friday today, but I hadn’t seen Gyuna since Monday.  She didn’t come to class on Wednesday or today, so I was a little concerned about where she was.  She said she had gotten sick, but it sounded like she was getting a bit overwhelmed as well.  She had a project in her other CS class, but for some reason, she didn’t start it.  It sounded like the project would take several hours to complete, and it was going to be due the following Monday.  She said she had submitted a petition to withdraw from the class and take a lower-level CS class.

But today, she asked if I could meet with her at the Cougareat at 5 to help her with the CS 180 labs.  Later in the day, I texted:

```Me: Yo, are you able to make it to the Wilk at 5?```

```Gyuna: Can we do 6 hon```

It was 6:15, and I still didn’t see Gyuna, so I gave her a call.  “Hey, are you able to make it to the Wilk?” I asked.  “If you can’t today, that’s okay.  We could do tomorrow.”

“No, I’ll be there,” she said.  She sounded like she woke up from a nap.  It wasn’t for another half hour before I saw her.

“Bro, I’m so stressed,” she said when she showed up at 6:45.

“What happened?”

“I’m so stressed about my CS 111 class.  I haven’t even started on that project, and the midterm is going to be the following week, and I’m SO not ready for it.  I just want to drop the class.  Also, it sounds like girls are hitting on Christian.  I just want to go up to them and punch them all.  He’s MINE!”

Gyuna said she was willing to pay for dinner, so I got some Chick-fil-A.

“You’re not going to wait for me?” Gyuna asked when I was about to go back to the booth we were sitting in.  “Wow, you’re not a Korean at all.”

She was right.  But I waited for her to get her food from Wendy’s.

“Oh my gosh, I pay for your meal and then you hide your face behind your Chick-fil-A bag?” Gyuna said when we were settled down.  She moved my bag to the other side of the booth.

Wow, so sassy.  I guess she was in a mood.

After we ate, she and I got to work on the CS 180 labs.  "It's so bad that for some reason, I feel so smart when you're in my presence.  That’s when I feel like I can figure things out," she said.  I didn’t do or say too much.

“What does the error message say?” I asked.  That was all I needed to say before she’d be able to figure out the problem.

“I don’t know why I can’t figure this stuff out at home.  I get so distracted, and then I try to do some CS homework, and then I get stuck.  I’m honestly rethinking about my major.  I don’t think data science is for me.  I can’t imagine myself programming all day.  But I’d be so bougie.”

“Well, it looks like you’re figuring out that even though you’d make lots of money, it’s more worth doing something you'd like to do, even if it means not as much money, right?”

Gyuna looked at me.  “No.”  She and I laughed.  “I’ll do my programming and then go on vacation.  And then go back to work and be miserable.  And then go on vacation and feel better.  Being bougie would be so nice.  That’s what you’re going to be: a rich, bougie data scientist.  Like, can you adopt me?  If I had a rich husband, I’d just stay at home and Amazon shop all day.  And I’d cook for you.”

For the most part, she and I just talked about stuff.  The topic somehow transitioned to our patriarchal blessings.  “So what tribe are you?” Gyuna asked.  “Are you Ephraim too?”

“I’m actually not,” I answered.  “I’m from Naphtali.”

“Na- what?  What is that?" She started researching.

"I don’t remember.  I had done some research on it, but I don't remember what it meant."

After some research, Gyuna said, “You’re a hind let loose.  In other words, you’re a scout who goes out and comes back with good news.  You’re also one with natural affection.”  She turned to me and smiled.  “No wonder I feel so much better now!  You're one who emanates natural affection.  And smartness too.  You know, when I have smart people around me and I feel smart, then I’m going to think that they’re from the tribe of Naphtali."

That was quite a conclusion.  Plus, I didn't feel like I emanated affection.  Probably the complete opposite.

“Well, I’m going to need to go soon,” I said when it was nearing 11.  Carli had invited me to her birthday party at her place, and it was going to start at 11.  So we walked together outside.

“I like you,” Gyuna said.

Uh.  What?

"Remember when I said we'd hang out together?" she recalled.  "Aren't you happy?"

I wasn't sure if "happy" was the word, maybe more like "nice."  It was weird because that sort of "hanging out" was what I wanted at the beginning of last fall, but now I didn't have much of a desire for that.  "I guess," I simply said.

"I'm happy," Gyuna said.  "I'm not ashamed to say that.  It's nice to have someone I know coming here to BYU."  She continued.  “I think you’re one of the most honest people ever.  You’re a really easy person to read.”

I was an easy person to read?  “That’s the first time anyone has ever said that about me,” I said.  “I don’t think I’m easy to read at all.”

“Yes you are.  Your face tells everything.  When you immediately say no to something, then I know you mean it.  But when you hesitate and make your face and then say no, it actually means yes.”

I laughed.

“You’re also very much a tsundere,” Gyuna added.

“What’s that?”

“A tsundere?  You don’t know what that is?  Basically it means that you can seem very cold on the outside, and if people don’t know you, they might judge you to be very cold-hearted.  But when people get to know you, you’re actually really warm and friendly.  I think people just need to get to know you.”

Hm.  Interesting.  My past friends didn’t talk much about my qualities or personality.  One thing that I liked about Gyuna was how she liked me for my character.  She might have liked me for my musical talent or my intelligence or being “the mission president’s son,” but I felt like she primarily liked me for who I was, no matter who was in my network.  I learned qualities about myself from her that I didn’t know I had.  She and I hung out almost every day at this point.  Not seeing each other for four days was the longest time we hadn’t seen each other ever since the beginning of the semester.

## Section 2

September 29, 2022.

```Me: Btw how far have you gotten on the labs for CS 180?```

```Gyuna: I will be working on them tonight```

```So nowhere```

```Why, is it hard```

```Cuz Im going to Rexburg tomorrow```

```Me: Lololol I’m not surprised. I bet either you’ll go back to Rexburg the following weekend or Christian will come back down here.```

```You’ll have to give me an update on how Christian’s doing the next time we see each other.```

```Gyuna: Ya he’s been a depressed sad boy ever since he crashed his shoulder so im going down to suprize```

```Me: Oo surprises. I guess he’ll like that.```

```Gyuna: Awwww u care about him don’t u u lil cutieee```

```Me: He’s like one of the only other people who actually acknowledges me and talks to me.```

```Gyuna: What noo u got tons of friends here u so popular boi```

```Me: Uhh people know my name, but that’s about it. Like even with my roommates, I bet they don’t know what my hobbies are.```

```Gyuna: Bro```

```U don’t know your hobbies either lol```

```Except for playing piano and work out while you listen to AKB48```

```Me: I mean, I don’t really have conversations with my roommates. My roommates have conversations with each other though. So I can tell that there’s not really much of a connect between my roommates and me.```

```Gyuna: That’s some b moment imma beat them up```

```Me: It’s okay. I won’t see them again in like a few years.```

```Gyuna: Savage```

```But true```

```Me: Yeah. It might be the same with you too.```

```Don’t you ever wonder why things are like that sometimes?```

```Gyuna: I mean yaaa but kinda over it lol```

```Me: Like in high school, I had a few friends. But I don’t really talk to them anymore. I mean, if I saw them again, I’m sure we’d catch up and stuff. But that connection is basically gone.```

```I mean, truthfully, it would be nice to be able to connect with my roommates, but it’s disappointing when there isn’t really a connection between the two of us. Like, it has to be something that both people have to desire. And it’s not like I can control if they want to have that kind of connection. So I’ve kind of been done having that kind of desire for connection since it seems like there’s rarely anyone who desires that.```

```It's intriguing yet disappointing to see how my roommates seem to connect with each other but I can’t do the same. Basically the story of my life.```

```Gyuna: That does piss me off... maybe they r freaking racist lol```

```Me: Maybe. But maybe not. It’s been a pretty common pattern throughout my life.```

```Gyuna: You do have a distinguished personality which is very innocent and pure some ways. It’s a great thing and a rare personality that u can find from college kids nowadays```

```I like you because of the specific personality! I love messing with you and teasing you bro u make me feel so fun and comfortable lol```

```Christian feels the same way```

```Hehe```

```Me: Innocent and pure? Is that what makes people feel like I’m not connectable?```

```Gyuna: Noooooooo bro it’s their choices```

```Welp there’s “American preferred” personality like crazy social outgoing party and like u know what u know stuff and most of the time they are not innocent or pure```

```I feel pretty overwhelmed to deal with those kinda people but a lot of kids here in Provo tend to love that personality```

```Me: All of my roommates are STEM majors, and I guess you can say they kind of fit the stereotype of being STEM nerds. I guess that’s how they can relate to each other. It’s just weird that I don’t really feel like I find a pattern in those I’ve been able to relate with.```

```Gyuna: I don’t know are they white?```

```Me: Yeah```

```Gyuna: I have a hard time getting along and connected to white```

```Me: One of them served his mission in Japan.```

```Gyuna: It don’t matter u r not from Japan lolol```

```Me: But why should it matter if they’re white on the outside? That’s the part that I don’t really understand.```

```They could paint themselves black.```

```Gyuna: I don’t understand that either...but lots of time it is easier for me to be connected w Asians or some different races```

```Me: It’s interesting that most of the people who do approach me are Asians. And they seem more approachable and connectable.```

```It’s weird because I’ve grown up in the US my whole life, and I only know English fluently. But because I look different, that’s what makes the difference?```

```Gyuna: To some people they do. But you don’t act like a typical white kid```

```Even if you were born and raised here in America```

```Me: Like even in our class, you can kind of see the dichotomy. The Asians all sit together. The whites all sit together. There’s not much of a mix.```

```Gyuna: Yea...I try not to do it most of the time lol. The reason why im sitting w ya is because u r my friend hehe```

```Have you never felt you are different and being looked and judged differently from these white kids who are the majority in your life?```

```Cuz ever since I came here, I’ve been feeling that way every single day```

```Me: Oh definitely. I came to realize that when I came here to BYU too. I have a couple of white friends from back in my stake in Kentucky, and they seem to run into people who actually talk to them.```

```I just wonder if I’ll end up still feeling that way if I do end up moving out of Utah with this newfound knowledge.```

```Gyuna: Ya! People don’t talk to me or feel intimated to talk to me because I am different from them to them.```

```The whites are not gonna change even though they say no racism. They will still keep in their circle and interact with each other because they feel comfortable that way.```

```But there are people who are more open than others and who can connect you to the white society?? And that’s where you find your opportunity to be more embraced by this society```

```I don’t know it’s a messed up society```

```Me: Idk. Honestly, last school year made me kind of give up on having a desire to connect with people. But then you came along, and we started hanging out. To be completely honest, I felt a little out-of-place the first week when we hung out together at the library or when we went singing karaoke. But I like it when we hang out. It’s just that I do have an underlying fear of having connection withdrawals. Like, I feel like this is how I should feel with my roommates, but I don’t, and it kinda makes me feel sad.```

I then saw that Gyuna was trying to call me.  I was already in bed, but I decided to get out and sit on the bench outside the apartment.

“Moshi moshi?” I greeted.  (It’s how people greet each other on the phone in Japanese.)

“Moshi moshi,” Gyuna said.  “Bro, I wanted to call because you texting about being sad and lonely made me feel sad and lonely.  I know it sucks not feeling connected to other people.”

“Well, I’m kind of trying to get over it by now,” I said.  “I think it’s just best that I don’t worry about things like that anymore.  If things don’t work out, then I’m just going to leave it be.  I’m not going to try to put in more effort with stuff like that.”

“Connections don’t just go away when people move.  They’re there, but it’s different being far away.  It’s a time to connect with other people who are around you.”  She then asked, “Michael, do you like me?”

That word again.  “Define 'like.’”

"Oh.  My.  Goodness.  Okuda, you know EXACTLY what I mean."

"Well, with BYU culture, you know that 'like' can have several different meanings."

"Bro, I HATE BYU culture.  I came here only because education is better than BYU-Idaho and tuition is cheap.  BYU culture freaking pisses me off."  She continued, "But when I tell you that I like you, you just say, 'Oh, thanks.'  You don't say anything back like, 'I love you.'  Don't you see?  How about right now, you say six sentences about how you feel about me.  Even if it's complete trash like one of my companions did to me, I'll probably just leave you, but I hope that's not going to be the case."

"Six sentences?"  I was kind of at a loss.  "I don't even know.  I'm speechless."

"Tell you what, write me a letter about how you feel about me. I'll give you until the next time we see each other.  I'm not sure if I'm coming back to Rexburg on Monday, but we'll see each other on Tuesday."

"What's happening on Tuesday?" We had classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and those were usually the only days that we saw each other.

"I was thinking about inviting you for lunch or dinner that day."

"Oh, that's so sweet,” I said.  “See, maybe that's why I'm not able to connect well with people.  I just don't do things like that for others."  It made me think.  "I honestly don't know what it is that I do or say that makes people feel like they're my friend."

"Will you cook for me?" Gyuna asked.

"Uh, I don't think you'd want me to cook for you.  I basically just cook pasta."

"Okay, I can try your pasta.  What do you put in it?  If it's just pasta and sauce, that's just gross.  There has to be some sort of meat."

"I usually put Jimmy Dean sausage with my pasta.  Maybe you can come to my apartment one day.  Then I can make it.  Plus, my place is a lot closer to campus than your place.  I rarely ever have people come over to my place though."

"Yeah, probably because you don't ever invite them to your place.  But that would be good.  And if your roommates are there, they might ask afterwards if you're dating me, and maybe that could be an ice breaker."  I hoped that my roommates didn't think I was trying to be in a relationship with Gyuna.

She and I ended up talking for about an hour.  "Well, I'll let you go,” Gyuna said.  “It's almost midnight, but don't forget to write me a letter."

...

The next day, I was doing my homework when I thought about writing Gyuna’s letter.  It wasn’t mandatory, but it seemed like a good exercise for me.  I honestly didn’t feel like I did too much for her, so maybe this would be an opportunity to show appreciation.

I was still lost about what I was supposed to write.  I got out a sheet of paper and put today’s date on it.

“Hey, Michael.”  I looked up to see that it was Carli.

“Oh, hey,” I said.

“I’ve gotta look at some bacteria, but I’ll come back down and chat later.”

I went to work on writing up that letter:

```Gyuna,```

```Not gonna lie, I sorta forgot what I was supposed to be writing about lol. It's been a hot minute since I last wrote a handwritten letter.```

```This semester has been quite eventful mostly due to you, and I'm grateful for it. Idk what life would be like w/o having you as a friend. And I'm glad Christian approves of me. I feel like most dating relationships prefer to not want to associate w/ other people.```

```At the beginning of the semester, I was anticipating another semester of going to classes, doing research, and studying at the LSB all day every day like I did last school year. Maybe I would've been fine w/ that, but after all of the times that we've hung out, I can't imagine what it would've been like if I was just studying at the LSB all day every day, even though that was my life last school year. You make really good food, you actually talk to me, and I feel like I've met people and gone places that I wouldn't have w/o you.```

```I know I told you this during our phone call last night, but when you invited me to go sing karaoke at the end of the first week of the semester, I was pretty hesitant. I had already made plans to just study, study, study like usual and not have a social life. But I actually enjoyed my time. Even during that week when you'd tag along to study w/ me at the library, I didn't expect anything like that to happen.```

```But I do have to be honest and say that I have a fear deep inside me that when we do part, what will life be like? I won't really have a social life anymore. I mean, I interact w/ my professor and teammates for research, and I have to talk to the people in leadership for the data science club. I guess that's why I survived w/o friends last school year. I guess people are just steppingstones that simply help me get to the next stage of life and that's it. I've```

I saw Carli coming downstairs.  I flipped the paper over and hid it with my folder.  "Hey, Michael, what are you studying?" she asked.

"Just some stats," I said as I quickly switched my tab to my stats homework.  "What are you doing for the weekend?"

"Erika invited me to watch conference with her.  You should come along if you're available tomorrow."

"I'd probably be down tomorrow morning.  Are you going to her place?"

"I'm actually not sure.  I'll text you once I know.  I'll see you later."

Once she was out of sight, I went back to writing my letter...

```I've learned that I should probably be grateful for the steppingstones in my life, but I guess it doesn't feel natural.```

```Anyway, I think I got off topic. I hope we can still hang out, even when we don't have classes together. But another part of me suppresses that hope in case that doesn't end up happening. I think I've tried to be happy being alone, even though people say that human interaction is a necessary part of good emotional health. But I feel like there should be a way of being happy despite the circumstances. I hope this is the kind of letter you were looking for.```

```Your chingu (friend),```

```Michael Okuda```

October 1, 2022.  "How are your parents?" Carli asked.  I was at her place for the morning session of general conference.  It was just her and me.  I was thinking other people would also watch with us.

"I don't know,” I answered.  “I don't talk to them too often.  I think my mom called me about a month ago."

"Michael!  You haven't talked to your parents in a month?  I talk to my mom like six times a day.  But it's only for like five minutes per time between classes.  Maybe I'm annoying her."

"My mom just called me out of the blue.  They're probably really busy, and the time zone difference is pretty big."

"Michael, those sound like excuses."

"But I do have a group chat on Messenger, and I hear from them there about once a week on average.  I did text them yesterday about how I've been interviewing with several companies for an internship.  My dad responded with a thumbs up, and that was it."

"Really?  That's so funny."

It was nice of Carli to invite me over.  It was a bit strange that she had been one of my best friends.  It didn’t feel like that anymore.

_(November 2018; college freshman) Tonight, Carli and I had planned on going on a date by making brownies and playing some card games, so I met her at her dorm, and she drove us to my apartment._

_While Carli and I were making brownies, I asked, “So how are classes going for you?”_

_“Classes are going well,” she answered.  “I think I have a B in my floral design class, but it should go back up to an A.  Hopefully.”_

_“Is Chem 105 treating you well?”  That was one of BYU’s most dreaded classes._

_“Yeah, that’s actually the highest grade out of all of my classes because I understand the concepts well.”_

_“What classes have you signed up for next semester?”_

_“I’ve got a couple chemistry classes, PD Bio, and some other classes.  What about you?”_

_“I’ve got C S 142, MATH 290, MATH 313, American Heritage, The Eternal Family, and Beginning Organ.”_

_“How many credits is that?”_

_“16.”_

_Carli just shook her head.  “Michael, that’s quite a lot.”_

_“Yeah, I know, but the major academic plan shows pretty much that schedule for the winter semester of my freshman year.  Plus, I’ve gotta balance that with a job.  You’re so lucky that you didn’t have to worry about taking freshman gen eds.”_

_“Yeah, I made sure to check that the community college’s classes would transfer, and they would for Writing 150 and American Heritage.  They were pretty easy classes.”_

_We played a few games and then ate some brownies before Carli left.  It was a short, two-and-a-half-hour date, but I was glad I was able to put a checkmark beside that commitment._

_“Look, it’s snowing!” Carli exclaimed.  I saw snowflakes outside in the quad.  It was about time that we’d have some winter weather._

_When I came back inside, Daynen asked, “So was that your date?”_

_“Yeah, she’s one of my good friends from Kentucky,” I replied.  “She’s wanted me to ask her on a date, so I’m glad I could check that off.”_

_“She’s really cute.”_

_“Everyone says that about her.”_

## Section 3

October 9, 2022.  It was another busy week with interviews.  I finished a fourth and final interview with AT&T.  It was a pretty rigorous process, but I felt really good about my last interview.

It was also that season of first-round midterms.  Things were getting pretty busy at this point, but I felt like I was doing pretty well balancing school, work, sleep, finding a summer internship, and even my social life thanks to Gyuna.

Speaking of Gyuna, she had gone up to Rexburg to visit Christian last weekend.  When she came back to Provo, her ride seemed to be having some car problems, so she didn’t arrive home until late in the night.  I didn’t see her in class at all this week, so I wondered what she was up to.  She invited me to have dinner at her place tonight.

“Surprise!”  It was Christian when he answered the door.  Yeah, it wasn’t a surprise to me anymore.  I honestly thought that Gyuna and Christian would meet only once in a while, but they were visiting each other basically every weekend.

Gyuna was lying on the couch.  It obviously looked like she wasn’t in the mood to do anything.  “Oh my gosh, why is she so pretty?”  She was talking to her phone.  “Hey, Michael.  I didn’t go to class at all this week.”

“What the heck?” I instinctively said.  “Why?  What happened?”

“My sleep schedule is messed up.  And I don’t feel like doing anything.  And I hate my major.  I go to CS 180, and I don’t understand what’s going on.  I feel like it’s so pointless to go to that class.  Ever since that car trouble on Sunday night, I’ve been going to bed really late.  Like, usually past 2am.  And I get all these nightmares, and it’s hard to stay asleep.  Also, the meat didn’t turn out right.  I’m pretty sure it’s rotten because the texture isn’t good.  I just feel like trash.”  She kept scrolling through her phone.

I saw the beef she had cooked on the stove and tried a few pieces.  “It’s not that bad,” I said.

“Don’t get sick,” Christian said.  “It’s probably not good to eat.”

I kept eating it anyway.

“Hey, Christian, can you feed me?” Gyuna asked.  He got a bowl of soup, carried it over to the couch where she was lying, and spoon-fed her.  “Isn’t this just the life, Michael?  This is what happens when your boyfriend’s a simp.”

“That looks extremely uncomfortable,” I said.  “I think it would be easier to at least sit up and eat.”

The following day, I invited them to come over to my apartment for lunch.  I made some fettucine alfredo sauce, pasta, and Jimmy Dean sausage.  They said they actually enjoyed it, even though they complained that eating plain pasta every day for lunch was gross.

The three of us then went to the LSB and studied until about 9:30, at which point we went to SLAB pizza.  Gyuna and Christian wanted to go to the movie theater to see a horror movie, or as Christian said, a "suspense" movie.  I wasn’t a fan of those kinds of movies though.

“Pleeeeeeease, can you go with us?” Gyuna asked for the tenth time.  “I’ve asked all my friends, and they said that they’ve already got plans.  Except there’s this one friend who said she could make it, but if you don’t go, then she’ll just be third wheeling, and we’d hate for that to happen.”

Well, that was okay.  What was bad about third wheeling?  "We can watch something else," I suggested.

"Do you really want to watch _Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile_?" she asked.  She sounded like she wasn't going to enjoy it, and Christian felt the same.

"Why can't we just watch a movie on your laptop and project it onto a TV?  Like at the library?" I asked.  Well, I guess it sounded like they wanted to watch a movie at 10pm and not any earlier.  They had their chances.

"You know, I used to not like cucumbers,” Gyuna said.  “But then I kept eating them, and now I kind of like them.  That’ll be the same thing with you and horror movies.”

I was really tired by the time I got home anyway, so I was kind of glad that I didn't go.  But it was good to see Gyuna and Christian.

...

October 21, 2022.  I received an internship offer with AT&T!  After those four stressful interviews, I was surprised to get an email stating that I had an offer!  The internship would be in Dallas, and I would get an actual salary!  And AT&T sounded pretty well-known, so it would look good on my resume.  There were other appealing factors about AT&T, so I accepted the offer!  I was super excited and super relieved that I had secured something.  Maybe Dallas would be my new home after graduation.  I’d work downtown and then go home in solitude every day.

...

“I think this will be so good to go to!” Gyuna exclaimed.  It was another Friday afternoon, and Christian had come down from Rexburg again.  Gyuna showed me an event on Instagram from the Korean Student Association.  They were going to have K-pop performances from different K-pop dance groups.

Gyuna and Christian came about an hour late, so I waited outside.  When they arrived, they were playing “ddu du ddu du.”

“Is this what Fuego is like?” I asked when the three of us went inside the Wilk Ballroom.  Gyuna and Christian liked to go to this one popular party place called Fuego that had Latin dancing.  They had tried to convince me to go for the past month.

“Fuego is a bit more intense,” Gyuna said.  “You need to go there too!”

The first part of it was dancing.  I sort of forgot what dancing was like, but Gyuna and Christian did their best to make me feel included.  The second part of the activity was the actual performances.  It was pretty fancy since some professional video people were videoing the performances.  Some of the performers were in actual K-pop dance groups in the area, and others were students who decided to do something together.  One of those student groups did a Blackpink song whose English-translated title was “As If It’s Your Last” (the song at the very beginning of the reflection).  I wasn’t much of a fan of the song since it talked about love and all that stuff.  I couldn’t relate to any of it.  But it was fun.  I was glad that Gyuna and Christian wanted me to go.

## Section 4

Even though it was great getting to hang out mostly with Gyuna and also Christian, I realized that I was starting to feel social withdrawals for the past month.  I noticed that on days that I didn’t hang out with Gyuna, I felt pretty sad and lonely.  I didn’t really talk to anyone else.  Sure, I had my research teammates and the TAs in the stats lab and some of my classmates, but it wasn’t like I did anything outside of school with them.  It didn’t help that I didn’t connect with any of my roommates.

Initially, I got really scared that I was feeling these social withdrawals.  I felt like maybe I needed to break off ties with Gyuna.  I was still skeptical trying to develop connections and relationships with people because who knew when Gyuna and I wouldn’t be friends anymore?  Then what would be the point of all of it?  If I were to break off ties with her now, then maybe I wouldn’t worsen the hurt.

But something made me feel like I shouldn’t give up.  Honestly, I couldn’t imagine what it would’ve been like to have a life like I did last school year: studying at the LSB by myself all day, every day.  Gyuna, Christian, and I had made so many memories.  Nothing was memorable about studying Linux commands or the hypergeometric distribution or the issues of multicollinearity in a regression model other than for exams and my future career.  Sure, navigating my career path was very important to me, but something was different about having a social aspect in my life.  It was something that I LIKED, and I was initially scared that I liked feeling that way.  It had been years when I last felt like I had a social life.

I also noticed Gyuna and Christian’s relationship with each other.  I often wondered why they liked to hug and cuddle and kiss, but they seemed generally happy being in a relationship.  What was great about it?  I guess I wouldn’t ever know.  But maybe there was something about being in a relationship that helped those people feel some sort of connection.  What was different about being in a committed relationship from any other kind of relationship?  At least from an outsider’s perspective like mine, there seemed to be talk about each other’s families, an openness to vulnerability, and lots of touch that friends normally wouldn’t do.

Now I was curious.  <u>I wondered if a relationship was the kind of connection that I needed.</u>  Even in high school and throughout the mission, I felt like something was missing, but I didn’t know what it was.  Maybe that missing thing was the knowledge of being in a relationship with someone.  After all these years of not listening to people talk about dating and relationships, I had no idea how people started relationships like that.  I was still a bit hesitant about how susceptible I might be to the Disease.  But for the first time in my entire life, I was open to the idea of being in a relationship with someone because maybe I would feel some sort of connection that would help fill this emptiness inside me.

But I was really nervous.  I didn’t know anyone.  Would it be best to get to know someone I didn’t know and work from there?  I had heard a lot about people meeting each other through dating apps during COVID.  I had heard mixed things about dating apps, but it seemed like my only choice.
So I downloaded some dating apps and started to learn the game of swiping.

...

“Heavenly Father, I’m thankful for Gyuna and Christian.  They have been so good to me.  Please bless them that they can do well in school.  I’m just confused though.  Even though they’ve been such great friends and the kind of friends that I had wanted a year ago, I don’t get why I still feel so empty and lonely.  Please help me to know if I should be using these dating apps, and please especially help me to know if I should try to pursue a relationship.  In the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.”
