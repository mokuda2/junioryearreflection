## Section 1

February 13, 2023.  Bryce told me that he was studying in one of the reserved rooms tonight, so I walked over when I was finished with dinner.

“I’m trying to make a list of things that we could do together,” I said.  I had made categories of things we could do, including hikes, restaurants, and movies.  I added Bryce to the note so that he could add ideas too.  We came up with a lot of things: orchestra, escape room, axe throwing, shooting, clothes shopping, and a bunch of other things I wouldn’t have done by myself.

We studied for the rest of the night.  I noticed that Bryce would occasionally stare at me.  “What?” I asked.

“You’re just really distracting,” he said.  “This is really embarrassing, but one of the reasons I started going back to dating was because I was watching this one Thai drama, and it made me feel so lonely.”

“What kind of Thai drama?”

“It was a gay romance drama.  I can’t believe I’m talking about this to you.”

“I don’t think it’s embarrassing.  My dad would show my family these Japanese rom-com dramas.  A lot of it didn’t make sense to me, but thinking back on them, I think I’d understand them a lot better if I watched them now.  Maybe we can watch that Thai drama!  What does your schedule look like?”

“I’m pretty busy during the daytime.  But most evenings around this time are good.”

“Yeah, I’m pretty busy during the daytime too,” I said.  “But we should spend time together.  You know, I think one of the things that turned me off about dating before I started dating guys was that it seemed to be an unspoken rule that a couple had to be around each other as much as possible.  And I just didn’t understand why anyone would want to do that to themselves or why people would want to make that kind of time commitment as a full-time student.”

“I know that dating takes a lot of time and money, but I actually want to spend time with you.  It’s not like I just want to go through the motions.”

“Yeah, same.  I want to spend time with you too.”

Most nights, Bryce and I would spend time at the library studying.  It wasn't as productive as studying by myself, but I liked seeing and talking to him.  At least it was more productive than studying with Gyuna.  Sometimes Bryce and I did other things, including watching the Thai drama.  He’d drop me off at my apartment at night, and we’d hold hands in the car.  Getting to see Bryce at the end of the day gave me something to look forward to.

We usually listened to the radio.  “Did that song just say, ‘I just killed my ex.’?” Bryce said.
I didn’t know who the singer was or what she was saying, but I heard her say it again.  I laughed.  The radio played that song pretty frequently.

“You told me you like that one K-pop group, Blackpink?” Bryce asked.  He opened his phone for me to play some music.

“Yes!” I exclaimed.  I played “ddu du ddu du.”  “This one is a classic K-pop song.  It’s got over two billion views.”

We listened to the song for a bit.  “I feel like I know you, but then I get these kinds of surprises,” he said.  “I wouldn’t ever think you’d listen to songs like this.”  I also played “As If It’s Your Last.”

...

It was around Valentine’s Day, which usually didn’t mean anything to me, but at the end of the week, we planned on going to Itto Sushi.  Bryce said he never had sushi before.

"I went here for the first time on Christmas Eve with my brother and sister-in-law," I said when we were seated.  "Then I went here again on New Year's Eve with the guy that I thought I'd get serious with.  And now I'm here again.  Talk about progress."

I also watched him use chopsticks for the first time.  He wasn’t too shabby for a first timer.  Watching Bryce experience new things was so much fun!

That weekend, Gyuna and Christian invited me to a party that Christian’s friend was DJing.  Aubree and some of Gyuna’s other friends were there as well.  After the party, Aubree, Bryce, and I were waiting outside for Gyuna and Christian to finish talking to their friend.

“So how do you two know each other?” Aubree asked Bryce and me.

“We’re just friends,” Bryce answered.

“Where did you meet?”

There was a pause.  “That’s a good question,” Bryce said.

“How’s Bryan doing?” I asked, trying to change the subject.

“I think he’s doing well.  He’s on a study abroad in London.”

When Gyuna and Christian were finished talking to their friend, we went to a boba place.  “I’ve never had boba,” Bryce said.

“You’ve never had boba?” I repeated.  “We’ll have to talk to Gyuna about what to get you.  She knows what flavors are good.”  So I got to watch Bryce try boba for the first time too.

I hoped he and I would have more of these kinds of experiences—getting to do new things together.

...

February 24, 2023.  “Moshi moshi?” I greeted on the phone.  It was Gyuna.

“Moshi moshi,” she greeted back.  “What are you doing today?”

“I’ve got classes in the afternoon and then TA hours after that.  Then I’ll go home and eat dinner before I see Bryce.”

“Oh yeahhh.  I forgot about that.  Now that you’re in a relationship with someone, you’re going to spend most of your time with him.  Bro, we haven’t seen each other in a while.”

“I mean, I’ve invited you to study with us.”

Gyuna laughed.  “Yeah.  I guess I’m just not motivated to come back to campus.  Do you and Bryce make out all the time?”

“Honestly, not really,” I answered.  “We’re not really like that.”

“What?!  What do you do then?”

“Mostly just study at the library.  And then he drops me off at my apartment at night.”

“Do you at least give him a goodnight kiss?”

“No.  But we hold hands in the car.”

“Bro, if you’re not gonna make out with him, you should just hang out with me.”

Today, I went to Gyuna’s apartment doing homework.  “Aubree broke up with Bryan the other day,” she said.

“Really?  How’s she doing?”

“So far, she’s been doing all right.  But I’m pretty sure she knows you’re gay.”

“How do you know?”

"Well, I think she caught on.  You should talk to her about it and be like, 'I know you know.'"
So when Aubree came into the living room, that was exactly what I said.

"Yeah.  I know," she said casually.

"But how did you know?" I asked.

"When Christian was here before the beginning of the semester, I told Gyuna and him that I probably wouldn't be with another guy alone unless they were gay since I was still dating Bryan at the time.  And they looked at each other like they had something they knew that I didn't.  And Gyuna was like, 'I have a friend who's gay.'"

"This was the night when you came out to Christian," Gyuna said.  "And I think I gave it away because it's not like I have that many friends anyway."

"I didn't want to make assumptions, but I felt Gyuna was talking about you," Aubree told me.  "Plus, you always hang out here alone with Gyuna, and Christian said he isn't bothered by it.  And then a few days later, I came into the apartment, and you, Gyuna, and Christian were watching that gay movie, and I was like, 'Confirmed.'"  The three of us laughed.  "Cuz you know, of course Gyuna and Christian would want to watch a gay movie."

"Honestly, I wasn't a fan of the movie," I said.  "I don't like how they oversexualize things."  That was something that I noticed with gay movies.  I felt like media was a huge influence on people's perspectives about what it was like to be gay.  The gay community made up the Minority in society, so from a revenue perspective, making a movie about a heterosexual couple would've been more relatable to the Majority and therefore would have made a lot more potential revenue.  And the media made it seem like the topic of "being gay" was too mature, as a majority of movies that were gay-related were rated PG-13 or rated R.  If movies with gay romance were as clean as Disney movies, maybe society wouldn't think that "being gay" was wrong or defective.

"And then at the party last week when it was just the three of us outside, remember when I asked Bryce how you two met?” Aubree continued.  “I feel like that's something you'd normally ask, but Bryce just crossed his arms and was like, 'We're just friends.'"  The three of us laughed again.

Aubree wanted to hear my story, so I told her from the beginning.  "I have a friend who's bi," she said.  "She said that in some ways, she's hesitant about being considered part of the LGBTQ community because of all the pride flags and stuff.  She feels like the symbols behind them are people who ridicule and have that attitude that they're better.  Same thing with stuff like Black Lives Matter."

"I can understand that too," I said.  "I feel like when I see pride flags, I think of people who just scream and protest and patronize others for their narrow-mindedness.  Not a fan of it.  Bryce says he doesn't like pride-related stuff either."

Aubree then talked for half an hour about relationship issues that I had never considered before.  She felt like Bryan was being indecisive about wanting marriage when that was what she was looking for.  She now had a desire to date other guys, so that was one reason they broke up.

Gyuna was having mixed feelings again about breaking up with Christian.  I felt like it was going to be more difficult the longer she put off a committed decision.  "Why do you feel like breaking up with him?" I asked.

"I just don't see much progress with our goals," she answered.  "Every time he comes here, we just get really lazy.  We don't get much done.  And I don't see myself marrying him.  But every time Christian and I talk about it, I feel so bad because Christian gets so sad."

I felt like Gyuna was probably going to feel bad again for hurting Christian's feelings and would still try to make things work.  I wondered why Christian was still persistent about wanting to marry Gyuna when she didn’t see that happening.  Dating was so complicated.  I didn’t understand how people got married.

## Section 2

February 26, 2023.  As I got to know Bryce better, I did feel more and more attracted to him.  It had been a couple weeks since Bryce and I got official, but I sometimes still thought about Connor.  I definitely didn’t think about him as much as I had when Bryce and I became official, but I occasionally freaked out thinking about Connor.

```Me: Bruh I just woke up. And I had a dream about Connor.```

```Whyyyyyyyyyy```

```Gyuna: Ew```

```Me: I was back in my house in Kentucky, and he was just chilling in my bed on his phone. I was getting ready for the day for school, even though it was like 9:30am.```

```I just wanna get over him.```

```Gyuna: Ugh```

```Get over him```

```Flush him down```

```Me: *flushing sound```

```Oh no it's clogged. He's too big.```

```Gyuna: Ewwwwewweww```

```Me: He's not geri geri (diarrhea). He's a big piece of manure.```

```Gyuna: Ugh```

```Ughhhhh```

```Me: Usually the toilet gets clogged because I've used too much toilet paper, but this time around, it's literally because the circumference of this piece of manure is too big.```

```I literally have to pull him out and cut it in half lengthwise for this thing to go down the toilet.```

```I'm like *snip snip```

```But I don't have the courage to go down there and grab him and confront him. I think it'd just be best to leave the toilet like that. Until I have to use the bathroom again...```

```I just wish there was a janitor who could just clean it up for me...```

```Gyuna: Omg that sounds so gross Wth```

```A freaking slasher movie Michael```

```Just let him go, ew he's a big dump don't touch it```

I felt like it was appropriate for me to talk to Bryce about my feelings for Connor.  Tonight, Bryce asked me about how I felt about our relationship, so I felt like it was appropriate to be completely transparent with him.

“So... I do have something to talk to you about,” I said when Bryce parked his car in front of my apartment complex.

“Yeah, what is it?” Bryce asked.

“When I told you that I wanted to tell you something before we got official, I wanted to tell you that I still had feelings for another guy.”  I told Bryce a bit about Connor.  I could tell something was on Bryce’s mind.  “What are you thinking?” I asked.

"I am a bit jealous," Bryce answered.  "I'm that type.  But I'll get over it in a few days.  I guess it’s hard to believe that you have feelings for someone else since I’m pretty loyal when it comes to commitment."

I squeezed his arm.  "I’m so sorry!  I really want to get over Connor.  He was really sweet, but now all he wants is my body.  I don't want to deal with him anymore.  I want to focus on you."

"Do you have feelings for me?"

"I do!  I think you're very mature.  You know what you want.  Connor said he wants to be in a long-term relationship 'eventually.'  And you're straightforward and honest, which I like too."

"I thought I kind of scared you when I told you what I was looking for.  That's just how I am."

“I actually liked how straight-to-the-point you were about expectations.  I can be a pretty direct person too.”  I snuggled my head on his shoulder.  "I like you."

"I like you too.  But if you feel differently, you'll tell me, right?"

"Yeah.  And you'll tell me too, right?"

"I will, though it would be hard because my main concern is making sure I don’t hurting you.  It would be so difficult."

"And you'd tell me why you feel the way you do, right?"

"I will for sure."

"Well.  I didn’t want to keep secrets.  Gyuna said it would be wise for me to wait to tell you about this.  And I kinda felt that way after thinking about it.  I was going to tell you whenever we were about to be official.  That was why when you first asked me if I saw us being in a relationship, I sort of hesitated because we had only met in person for not even a whole week by that point.  Plus, I thought about Sam and how hurtful things could've been if he and I had been in a relationship without me knowing his values."

"Yeah, if you had told me that you were still in love with another guy, I would've been like, 'Aaaaand we're done.'"

I laughed.  I told him about my first heartbreak with Kent.  “I used to be so direct on dates.  When I was still going through that heartbreak, I’d talk about it on my dates.  Now I know not to do that.”

“Yeah, and if I were dating a guy like that, I’d be like ‘Aaaaand we’re done.’”

After some talk, I could tell Bryce was thinking again.  "What's on your mind?" I asked.

"It's all good.  I really am not jealous."

"Oh, I don't believe that."

"Well... I think it'd just be a few days."

"I like you.  I do."  He and I gave each other a kiss.

I was glad that I told him about Connor because it was not easy still having these feelings.  They were fading away slowly, but talking to Bryce about it felt as if a huge weight had come off my shoulders.

Bryce and I occasionally did have deeper conversations like that.  On another night, he drove us around Provo.

"You're a very rare person," he said.

"What do you mean?" I asked.  It was true that I had never met anyone who was quite like me, but I wanted to know what he meant.

"You're still part of the Church.  It's so hard to find those kinds of people.  One thing about my last boyfriend was that he said he was okay with the Church, but then towards the end of our relationship, he just started hating on it.  I couldn't deal with it."

"I know, it's hard to find people who are still part of the Church.  Sometimes I'm like, 'There's no one else!  They're all extinct!'  But what is it that you like about the Church?"

Bryce thought for a long moment.  "Everything.  The teachings, the doctrine.  Of course, there are some things that I question, but I know the Church is true."

"Have you ever wondered what will happen after this life?  I know we're taught that we’ll go to the spirit world and then we'll all be resurrected and then we'll all be judged before getting placed into one of the kingdoms of glory.  When I was in high school, exaltation was the goal, and I still find exaltation desirous, but I don't know if that's realistic for me.  I feel like my mission was what propelled me to start dating guys.  At the beginning of my mission, I thought that if I obeyed all the mission rules and the commandments that I'd be happy.  That's what we're told.  But I wasn't happy.  It wasn't until later in my mission that keeping the commandments and learning to love the people were things that had to come from the heart.  Of course, going through the motions can be a starting point, but it's not enough.  And I think that applies to marriage.  If I were to have a wife, I don't think I'd be able to fully love her in all aspects of a healthy marriage, even if I were to go through the motions.  I have no desire to touch a girl or have that sort of connection with any girl.  And I wouldn't want to put that kind of hurt on anyone or on myself or on our posterity if it gets to that point."

"I used to think a lot about my exaltation too, but I don't think about it as much anymore.  It's depressing to think about.  Sometimes I wonder, 'Why me?'  You know?"

"I've had those thoughts too.  Why would God allow something that would completely impede our progression?  I know that other Christians believe in a heaven and a hell, and I don't think they're completely wrong.  Even if I were to end up in the terrestrial kingdom, I wouldn't make any progress.  I wouldn't live with God.  I wouldn't be with my family.  I wouldn't be able to have posterity.  There's no progression—not just for a few years or decades or centuries or millennia, but for eternity.  That sounds like hell.  I know that a lot of gay members leave the Church, and I can sort of empathize why since it seems like we’re all doomed to that kind of hell.  What would be the point of trying to live the gospel if exaltation is only an ideal and not a reality?  But at the same time, I don't think the Church and my sexuality are complete opposites where I have to choose one and leave the other behind.  I know that the Book of Mormon is true, and those feelings and experiences are as undeniable as the feelings of my sexuality."

"It would be nice if God could just give me a book in detail about what would happen if I chose one way or the other.  It's so hard.  I don't want to live the rest of my life alone."

"I don't either.  I talked to Gyuna about this, and she told me that it's so important for me to receive personal revelation on this matter.  Before I started dating guys, I prayed about if this would be okay to do, and I never got any strong impressions, so I acted and dated guys.  And I still haven't gotten any impressions of a 'no' to this day.  It was something that confused me until I listened to a podcast of a gay guy who's also an active member of the Church, and he talked about personal revelation.  And I think that's how it has to be for us because it's a difficult thing to go through.  People who don't know what it's like to go through the way we feel don't know the struggles we wrestle with when it comes to eternal matters."

There was a long silence.  "Well, let's change the subject," I said.  "So... what kind of car are you thinking about getting?"  He had told me that he had been car shopping.

Bryce sighed.  "Hang on, I'm still kind of depressed."  After a few seconds, he told me about the trucks he was looking at and then shared everything about the mechanics of a car.  We just talked for an hour before Bryce said he needed to go.

I was glad that he and I also had that deep conversation.  And I was glad to hear that he still desired to be a member of the Church.  It was definitely a green flag for me.

## Section 3

March 3, 2023.  Bryce told me about an Asian cultural night that was happening at the Wilk tonight.  I told Gyuna about it, and she invited some of her friends.  Christian was in Provo too.

“There’s a girl at my work who’s clearly been flirting with me,” Bryce said while we were waiting for Gyuna and her friends to arrive.  “She asked me how many relationships I’ve been in, and I was like, ‘Three.’  And she was like, ‘What were they like?’  And I just avoided the question.  But today was the day when she asked me out.  And I just tried to change the subject.”

“Wow, what a heartbreaker,” I said.

“I ran into her just a few minutes ago when I was walking to the restroom.  She was just like, ‘Oh… hi…’”

He also told me that some of his school plans had changed and that he was going to apply to the police academy.  “I plan on taking fall semester off and then do part-time school next winter,” he said.  I wondered what that meant for our relationship.  It would’ve been more difficult that he wouldn’t be on campus in the fall, but maybe things would work out.

After the cultural event, Gyuna and one of her new friends mostly socialized with a bunch of different people.

"We should take a picture!" I said.  There was a Chinese-themed backdrop near one of the entrances.

"I can take the picture," Bryce offered.

"You’re going to be in the picture with us."

"No. I won't."

"Huh?  Why?" I asked.

"I don't like pictures of myself."

"But we have to make memories!  I'm terrible at making sure we take pictures."

"Well, that's fine with me."

Gyuna said she and her friends were going to an arcade up in Sandy, so we tagged along as well.  “What if I collected photos of you and put together an album just for you?” Gyuna asked Bryce.

“I’d be absolutely pissed,” he answered.

We took some pictures at the arcade anyway.  Gyuna also posted the picture of us at the Wilk.  I shared it on my story, to which I got a reply from someone:

```Connor: Is this your friends party you were telling me about?```

Oh shoot.  I was NOT expecting Connor to message me.  For a moment, my heart raced.  I wasn’t sure if it was because I was still trying to rid myself from the remaining feelings I had for him or if it was because I wasn’t sure if I should ignore him.  It had been about a month since he and I last messaged each other.  I knew that if he was going to ask about making out that I'd say no.  It was definitely not a temptation anymore.  But I didn't want to block him and burn bridges either.  So he and I messaged each other for a bit.

He then sent me a TikTok with a caption along the lines of, "this initial will kiss you soon,” with an “M” written out.  He said he wasn’t opposed to it.

I wasn’t going to tell him about Bryce because I had already made up my mind about saying no to Connor about making out anyway whether or not I had a boyfriend.  So I messaged him:

```Me: I don't think I realized how hurt I would be doing something like that until after our last conversation. And I don't think I realized how it would hurt you too. I want a LTR, and it sounds like you want one too. I want someone who wants me not just physically but emotionally too. The thought of you just wanting my body but not wanting to get to know me more than that hurts. And if one of us were to get into a LTR with us doing this, that would be detrimental for both of us. But I'm not opposed to us being friends like studying together or getting to know your friends and stuff like that. Save your kisses for someone you actually want to invest time and love in :)```

```Connor: I’ll respond more later. But you’re right, and that was a slap to the face. In a good way.```

A few hours later, he texted back:

```Connor: Ok, so basically you are right. I do want a LTR. I think sometimes I get sucked in by the culture of non-committal things in the community, and I am sorry for that. The last thing I want to do is hurt you. I need some time to think about it a little bit more, because I really don’t want to hurt you. But I would potentially be open to starting fresh again if you are. I want to figure out for sure what I am feeling a bit longer, but is that something you would maybe be interested in?```

I wasn’t sure if he was implying another try at dating or being friends.  I thought he wasn’t interested in going on dates with me anymore.

```Me: So... Kinda awkward, but I recently just got a boyfriend. It’s a long story. He and I are taking things slowly together, but so far, things have been good. And I hope it stays that way. So I’d say I’m not available dating-wise. But again, I’m not opposed to being friends. I don’t want you to be some mysterious, online person. But if you want space, I will respect that too.```

```Connor: Oh wow congrats! Who is he?```

```Also you should have just told me that before! Haha```

```Also I feel stupid for suggesting that since you have a boyfriend. I wouldn’t have if I knew that```

```Me: His name is Bryce. He goes to byu and is studying exercise and wellness. He wants to go into the police academy.```

```Oh. Well. I didn’t think I’d have to bring it up because I would’ve said no to just making out whether or not I had a boyfriend anyway. Plus you told me that you weren’t interested in dating me anymore, so I didn’t think it would’ve been an option.```

Connor and I texted each other a bit more.  He said he had gone on a few dates but that nothing seemed to be sticking.  He expressed how frustrated he was with his dating life.
But was he trying to hint that he was interested in going on another date with me?  I had been trying so hard to move on.

...

March 8, 2023.  I met Gyuna at the Cougareat for dinner.  She unexpectedly bumped into one of her friends, and she decided to eat with us.

“Hey, I feel like I’ve seen you before,” Gyuna’s friend said.

“Really?” I exclaimed.  “Sorry, I don’t think I know who you are.”

Gyuna and her friend occasionally talked in Korean.  Then her friend asked me random questions every now and then.  First it was, “How are you?” and then, “Have you ever been in a relationship with someone?”

“It’s complicated,” I answered.

“Yeah, it’s pretty complicated,” Gyuna agreed.

Her friend kept insisting on telling her if I was in a relationship with someone though.

“No, I’m not in a relationship,” I lied.  “Again, things are complicated.”

“He might get into one,” Gyuna said.

Gyuna and her friend still spoke to each other in Korean, and her friend asked me some very random questions.  I felt a bit creeped out.

After she left, Gyuna asked, “Did you understand what was going on?”

“Not really,” I answered.  “Y’all were speaking Korean.  But I did feel a bit creeped out.”

“You couldn’t pick up what was going on?  Bro, you’re so bad at social cues.  She thought you were really cute.”

“Oh.”  That was why she asked me for my number and where I lived and what I was going to be doing later tonight.  “Yeah, I did feel a bit creeped out by her.”  Maybe this was how straight guys felt if they got hit on by a gay guy.  I never wanted to do that to someone.  “Is she usually like that?”

“No, not at all!  I’ve never seen her like that.”

“Honestly, I don’t think I want to see her again.”

Bryce was heading to the library to study later tonight.  Gyuna said she was going to the gym with one of her other friends, but she wanted to tell Bryce about what happened.  “You’re going to be so boring if you tell him the story,” she said.  I guess she did like being dramatic.

“I’ve never been hit on by a girl,” I said.  “I did not like that.  If it were a cute guy and he had good character, then maybe I wouldn’t mind it.  But her…  Ew.”  I definitely didn’t want to experience anything like that again.

## Section 4

March 12, 2023.  Over the weekend, I went to Shari and David’s place and helped clean the house.  Bryce was back home in American Fork since he had to play the organ for a funeral.  But when he came back to Provo, he said he wanted to see me, so I went to his apartment that night.  He had gotten into this one game called Terraria and showed me what it was about.

But tonight, we had another deep conversation.  "You know, one thing that annoys me is that my roommate's fiancé is ALWAYS at my apartment," Bryce said.  His roommate and his fiancé were always the first people I met when I went to Bryce’s apartment.  "She'll leave around midnight, and then when I wake up, she's already there.  I mean, she's really nice.  It's just kind of annoying.  But I guess that's what it's like to be in love."

I nodded.  "I wonder what it feels like to be in love," I said.

"I wonder that too."

I could tell that Bryce was thinking about something.  "What are you thinking?"

He hesitated.  "I just don't want to hurt you."  He rolled his chair over and gave me a hug.  I didn't know what he meant.  After a few seconds, he said, "I honestly don't know if this relationship is right for us.  I don't feel like I love you romantically."

Initially, I was a bit confused and devastated.  He had texted me that he really wanted to spend time with me tonight.  "What do you mean when you say that you feel like you don't love me in a romantic way?" I asked.

"I don't think about you that often.  And I still have so much to work on, especially about school and work and the Church."  He talked about some of his personal experiences.

"When did you start feeling this way?"

"When we had that conversation about the Church, that was when I started having these concerns.  I've tried not to think about the state of our souls for a really long time, but they've started to surface again."

"Are you thinking about leaving the Church?" I asked.

"No.  I don't plan to."

"Well, I don't either."

"I feel like I need some time to think about this.  Plus, I feel like you're too good for me.  You're so gentle and kind towards others, and I'm over here just irked by people sometimes."

“Aw, Bryce!”  I held his hand.  "I really like how honest you are.  Not just that you're direct, but you'll do the right thing.  You know the rules.  And you're really responsible.  Honestly, when I first met you, it was definitely not a love-at-first-sight kind of thing, but as I've gotten to know you better, I feel more and more attracted to you.  I mean, I was still really into Connor."

"It sounds like you still are."

"Well... Definitely not like it was when I first met you.  But yeah, I still sort of have feelings for him."

"It's starting to make sense."

"What do you mean?"

"I could tell something was off, especially when we became official.  You seemed hesitant about it."

"Really?  Was I that obvious?"

"I'm pretty good at reading people and gauging what they're thinking."

"Dang.  Well...  This was what I meant when I said I wanted to talk to you about something before we got official.  And when I told you that I wanted to get over him, I really meant it.  I wanted to focus on you, but if you don't feel like a relationship is going to work anymore, then..."

"You won't get hurt, will you?"

I wasn't sure what to say.  Even though I still had feelings for Connor, I knew Bryce a whole lot better.  He treated me well, and he and I had made so many good memories.  But I also knew that we were "trying" this new thing called “being in a relationship” and that things might not work out.  I just couldn't believe that things were going to end like this.  "If we were to continue this relationship, wouldn’t both of us get hurt more later down the road?”

Bryce nodded.

Another pause.  “Honestly, I don't think I'll be too hurt,” I finally responded.  "Gyuna told me that the first relationship is so important because it's what sets a lot of expectations with future relationships.  She told me that if a guy is manipulative and takes advantage of me, then in my next relationship, I'll think that it's the standard or the norm.  But I feel like this has been such a great first relationship."

"I've been happy with this relationship too.  It's a million miles better than the last relationship I had.  And I still want to be friends.  I know that a lot of people say that kind of stuff, but I absolutely mean it.  But if you don't want to see me anymore, it'll hurt, but I'll respect it."

"I do want to be friends.  I don't want to ghost you.  But the thing is, I've told people in the past that I want to be friends with them, but sometimes that kind of thing takes up so much time, especially when my goal is to find a long-term relationship—which takes up so much time anyway.  Sam and I have decided to stay friends.  He and I will occasionally text each other, and we sometimes meet in person, but that's about it.  With Mason, I thought he'd be a really good friend and a good influence on me.  But after I told him that I didn't feel for him, he and I haven't texted each other for a couple months now.  It's kind of sad.  And Kent, he told me that he'd be down to be friends.  But I didn't feel like he reciprocated, and it hurt.  So I'm just saying from past experience that I don't know what it would be like if we were to just be friends.  I hang out with Gyuna a lot, and she really likes you, and we've hung out together a few times.  So I could see it working out."

"I like Gyuna too."

"I think she's biased, but she said that she likes you out of all the guys I've gone on dates with.  But the first time I met you was also the first time she met you, so I didn't talk to her about you as much as other guys."

"Well, do you REALLY want to be friends?"

I hesitated again.  I wanted to say yes, but I didn't want to say yes and then not be able to follow through.

"It seems like you have some reservations," Bryce said.

"I want to say yes, but..."  I couldn't find the words.  "I'm afraid that 'being friends' will only mean occasional contact like with Sam.  Or just no contact anymore like with Kent and Mason.  Would you want to date other guys?"

"Not immediately.  It'll definitely take some time before I feel like I'd be ready for that."

"I think it'd take me a few weeks for me.  I just need time to reflect on what I've learned and the times that we had.  But I still have feelings for Connor, so...  The thing is, I'm not sure what it'd be like to be in a relationship with him."  I smiled a bit.  "Have I told you how he and I first met?"

"No."

I told him all about it: the time when he and I matched on Hinge to the time that he and I first met in person to the time that he said he needed space to last week when he reconnected with me.  "I was a bit scared telling you about how I had messaged Connor last week because I felt like you'd get jealous."

"Yeah, I'm definitely the jealous type.  But it sounds like you really like him.  It sounds like you think about him a lot."  He gave me a side-eye.  I sort of shrugged.  It was kind of true unfortunately.  "I think that's what love is," Bryce continued.  "You just can't stop thinking about that person."

"When I was having that text conversation with him last week, I think he was trying to tempt me, but I told him that I was committed to you."

"Good.  Cuz otherwise, I probably would've thought about beating you.  Probably.  But it's totally okay that you feel this way.  It really is.  I mean, I am just a bit jealous that you're in love with another guy."

"Oh, I wouldn't say I'm 'in love.' I don't really know him.  I just have feelings for him.  But I have feelings for you too.  You’re a lot more emotionally mature than him."

“But I don’t date someone for their emotional maturity.”

I began to wonder what Bryce thought a relationship was supposed to look and feel like.  It was true that I felt more and more attracted to him as time passed, but it wasn’t like I always got butterflies around him or that he was constantly on my mind.

We talked some more but made sure to head out before parking security would check the lot that Bryce was parked in.  He gave me a big hug before we left.  “I think I’m starting to feel the hurt,” he said.

“Do you remember that one Blackpink song ‘As If It’s Your Last’?  That song has basically been my mood ever since I started dating guys.  I’ll have to share the lyrics with you.”

“As long as it’s not about killing your ex.”  He and I laughed.  “Have you heard the song ‘Let Her Go’?”

“I think I’ve heard of the title, but I’m not sure if I’ve heard the song.”

“It’s basically about how you don’t know what it’s like to have something or someone until it’s gone.”

We finally made our way out of the apartment.

"I'm going to miss these rides home," I said as we got into the car.

"I'll miss them too, but that doesn't mean this is the end," Bryce said.  "We can still do stuff as friends."

“Yeah, says the one who’s still holding my hand.”

“Well yeah, this is so difficult.”

As usual, he dropped me off at my apartment, and I watched him as he drove away.

## Section 5

Did Bryce and I actually break up?  I stopped walking for a moment to do a reality check.  Was I feeling okay?  Surprisingly, yes.  I felt just fine.  Was I going to be okay tomorrow morning?  I hoped so.  I didn’t want to think too hard about it.

The first thing that came to mind was to call Gyuna.  It was past 1 in the morning, but she was usually still up.  I was surprised when she didn’t pick up the phone.

```Bryce: Frick. I just got back to my room and now it’s hitting and it really really hurts.```

```Me: I’m surprisingly ok. But dang! I know how heartbreak feels. It sucks. But give it some time. I feel like time is what heals stuff like this.```

```Bryce: Well I’m glad that you are doing good at least that makes me feel a bit better```

```Me: Haha you heartbreaker. I think I’ll take a break from dating though. For just a few weeks. I better reflect on all that’s happened the past month.```

```It was so much fun getting to go to Itto Sushi and seeing you eat sushi and use chopsticks! Or when we went and had boba after the party. Some good memories.```

```Bryce: I know!!! But hey we can still make some good ones in the future. Like I said I just need some time to think.```

```Me: I tried calling Gyuna, but she didn’t pick up. Guess I’ll have to spill the tea tomorrow lol. But she’ll definitely be the one to go to as far as having fun.```

```Bryce: What do you mean?? You’re plenty fun```

```Me: Lol I don’t see myself as fun. I’m pretty quiet. People say I’m pretty boring.```

```Bryce: Mmmm not to me```

```Me: Well I’m glad! I don’t think Gyuna thinks the same so yall are the exception.```

```Bryce: Well then who better to be friends```

```Me: Lol ikr. Dang. But I better tell Gyuna about us. And about Connor...```

```Actually, maybe not about Connor. She’ll be like Ewwwwwwwwwwwwww```

```Bryce: That’s fine if your still in love with him```

```Me: Lolol Idk if I’d say I’m “in love” with him. What if he says no though? Or that he “has to think about it”? Well, I’m not asking anytime soon. I definitely want some time to reflect on our experiences together.```

But I did think a lot about Connor now.  What if he was actually interested in me?  I felt like at this point, I should’ve been able to let go of my feelings for him.  I didn’t understand why they were still there.  I thought a lot about him tonight.

After some more texting, Bryce asked if he could call me, so I stepped out of the apartment.

“Hey, so… could you actually not tell Gyuna about this?” Bryce asked.  “I still feel like I need to think about this.  Maybe we can talk on Friday with where we stand.”

I was a bit confused.  Didn’t Bryce and I break up?  He sounded like we hadn’t, even though it was pretty clear that we’d be friends.  “Uh, sure,” I answered.

The next day, I invited Bryce to study at the library in the evening.  A guy I had met the previous school year and his girlfriend had invited me to eat dinner with them, and I saw him at the library.  He and I made some plans.

“Who was that?” Bryce asked.

“I met him at institute about a year ago,” I answered.  “He and his girlfriend invited me to have dinner with them.”

After some time, Bryce drove me back to my apartment.

“So I know that I said we wouldn't talk about this until Friday,” Bryce said, “BUT... I really don't want to break up with you.  I think I was just being an idiot and was really emotional this past weekend with the funeral and school and everything else.  When I got home last night, the hurt hit me so hard.  And when you told me that you were feeling okay, I was like, 'Well, great.  I guess he doesn't feel for me anymore.'  And this morning, I thought that I'd wake up feeling okay, but the hurt still stung.  It was just a sharp physical pain.  And then when your friend came up to you at the library, I thought he was gay and that you two were going to go on a date, and... gosh, I was about to lose it.  I think a beating would've happened.  And I know that I wouldn't have felt that way if I didn't have feelings for you.  I guess my perspective of romantic love has changed.  It’s not as big of a thing as I thought.”

“You make it sound like romantic love is very underwhelming,” I responded.

“I think I’ve learned that even though I do have worries and concerns that they shouldn’t be reasons to stop a relationship.  And I don’t think I realized that I had feelings for you until I was about to lose you.  Before I started dating, I was really lonely.  Maybe even borderline depressed.  But for the past month, I haven't felt that way.  I'm so sorry about being wishy washy, but I still want to try this together.”

I had thought a lot about how Connor might have been someone I could pursue.  But Bryce was such a great guy.  I really did like being around him, and it seemed like he really liked being around me.  "I love that you love me as much as you do, but it doesn't seem fair that I don't love you as much as you do to me."

"And that's okay.  I don't expect that you absolutely love me after only a month of dating.  I'd be down to keep giving this relationship a try.  I think I realized that what I thought was love really wasn't what it was.  But I don't want you to be stuck in a relationship that you don't want to be in.  And I don't want to be in that kind of relationship either.  So do you want to continue this relationship?"

“Oh...”  I was a bit thrown off.  “Uh, I was thinking we'd talk about this Friday.”

"We can wait until then.  I just want you to know that I don't want to lose you."

"You don't want to lose me?  Like, our relationship?  Or as a friend?"

"Both.  I don't want to lose this relationship because I really like you."

“Well...”  I didn’t want to lose what Bryce and I had built.  We didn’t have any major relationship issues, and I wanted to see where things would progress.  “I feel like our relationship has been good.  And I do want to keep working on it.  It's just that I don't know what I'm going to do with my feelings for Connor.  Is there a hack to get rid of them?"

"Well, that's something I hope I can help you with.  After all, a relationship is something where we help each other work on things together."

"What do you need to work on?"

"Oh, I have so much to work on."

"Connor has definitely been my Bathsheba," I said.

"Well, I hope I'll be your Bathsheba."

I laughed.  "Uh, I don't think 'Bathsheba' is something you’d wanna be called."

So Bryce and I decided to continue this relationship.  And I was hoping that my feelings for Connor would fade away.  I hoped that my love for Bryce would consume those feelings at some point.  I really hoped so.

However, things didn’t feel the same.  I thought more and more about Connor, and those feelings seemed to be getting stronger and stronger.

After a couple days, I couldn’t stop thinking about him.  That morning I texted Bryce.

```Me: Idk why, but I've been thinking about Connor a lot. Help!! Get me out of this situation!```

```Bryce: How about you contact him and see if he is down for a date? Dead serious.```

What?

```Me: But... I'm scared of losing what we have. I'm scared that he won't love me as much as you do or that I won't love him as much as I feel. And idk if a relationship is going to be his priority. But maybe if he says no to a date, maybe that'll help me feel less for him. I just need to hear that from him. Bruh I feel terrible😭```

```Bryce: Well like I said, I don't want to be with someone who is constantly thinking about someone else, so I think you need to do what you need to do to figure out your feelings with him. Don't feel bad it will all work out one way or another.```

```Me: Ok. I will sort things out with him. But do you still want to meet tonight? If you want space, I totally understand.```

```Bryce: Yeah a bit of space would probably be good```

```Me: Ok. Again, I'm so sorry. I really thought these feelings would go away by now.```

```Bryce: It's really ok. Love is one of those mysteries 😂```

```Me: Bruh I freaking hate myself so much. But I'm going to text Connor rn.```

```Bryce: Sounds like a plan. Let me know on Sunday how it goes.```

I definitely didn’t expect to get Bryce’s permission to ask Connor if he was interested in going on a date.  But I needed to be transparent, and I hoped that Connor would be honest with me too.

```Me: Hey, so... I know you had mentioned about a week ago if I was potentially interested in starting things fresh. And I've thought a lot about it and wanted to let you know that I'd be interested. I know that it might sound off considering what I've told you, but I was wondering if you were still interested in going on a date. I hope that it'll be something more of actually wanting to get to know each other than merely just being physical though. And I hope you'll be honest with me about your feelings. If you need time to think or if you have questions, let me know.```

```Connor: Umm.. don't you have a boyfriend?```

```Me: Well. I did. He and I are sort of in limbo though. We had a pretty deep conversation on Sunday, and it feels like he and I are kind of on different levels with our feelings. He expressed some concerns that he's had in his personal life, and it sounded like he wanted some space initially. I also told him how I was feeling. To be completely vulnerable with you, I still have feelings for you. When you told me that you weren't interested in going on dates with me, I tried moving on. And I think my feelings for you were fading away. But then last week when you reached out, it sounded like you were open to going on dates again, and it was really tempting, but I wanted to stay committed. I liked how things were going in my relationship. But then Sunday happened, and I began to think a lot about you. I told him about you, and he was like, Kinda makes sense why some things were the way they were. And he literally told me to ask you if you're down to go on a date with me, so it's not like I'm hiding this from him. I just want to settle things because I feel like if I continue with this relationship that both he and I are going to get hurt more. So I hope you're honest with me about what you want and how you feel.```

```Connor: Hmm... interesting. I have a few thoughts. First is I'm sorry things maybe aren't going as well as you maybe hoped? I do feel a little weird that he told you to ask me if I'd go on a date even though you're still technically together. I think that I would go on a date with you but definitely not unless you two are officially not together anymore. That being said, I do not want to be the reason for a breakup. So that decision should be made without me in mind, like I want you two to figure that out. Also, I do feel interested in you and would like to go on a date. Obviously that doesn't mean we will for sure be boyfriends or anything, we'd need to go on dates and figure that all out but I can't guarantee anything you know? So I wouldn't want you to break up thinking we'd just get together for sure. Does that make sense?```

```Me: It's totally understandable. And yeah, I do realize that there's risk involved whether or not I decide to keep my relationship. I can't guarantee anything either. I'll think more about this and get back to you next week. Bryce and I plan on talking again on Sunday about this.```

```Connor: Sounds good. But yeah I will go on a date with you if that's what you decide. Let me know when you figure it out. Good luck with it all. Just do what feels right and best for yourself.```

Shoot.  He didn’t say no.  Did I want him to say no?

No.

Now I really had to sort my feelings out.  It sounded like Bryce wanted some space for a few days, so at least I’d get some time to think about things.

...

I was at the library with Gyuna that night.  “How’s Bryce doing?” she asked when she and I left the library.

“I think he’s fine,” I answered.  “Actually… I’m not sure what he’s been up to.”

“He didn’t come to the library tonight.  What happened?  Are you thinking about breaking up or something?”

She was probably saying that as a joke, so she looked shocked when I nodded.  “He and I have decided to give each other some space,” I said.

“What happened?  Who brought it up?”

“He did.”

“Bryce?!”

“He and I had a really deep conversation on Sunday,” I said.  “He said he’s had some personal concerns and that he didn’t have romantic feelings for me.  I thought we broke up, so that was why I called you so late.  But then on Monday, he said he realized that he still has feelings for me, but… it just doesn’t feel the same anymore.  So he and I plan on meeting again on Sunday to talk about our decision.”

“Aw, Michael, I’m sorry.  Dang, I wouldn’t have expected Bryce to feel like he wanted to break up with you.”

“Why doesn’t it feel the same?  It was definitely not love at first sight, but over time, I felt more and more attracted to him.  But it’s as if all of my feelings for him just got blown away by the wind.  I don’t get why it doesn’t feel the same anymore.”

“You got defensive.  When he said that he felt like breaking up with you, you put up a wall so that you wouldn’t feel as hurt.  But if he pulls out the breakup card and then wants to take it back, he’ll need to put in a lot more effort into the relationship and to make sure that you know he loves you.”

“He and I haven’t had any major relationship issues, so I want to continue to try our relationship.”

“Michael, you can’t TRY a relationship.”

“What do you mean?”

“You have to DO it.  Both of you have to be all in for the relationship to work.”

“When Bryce and I were discussing about being official, we both agreed to try a relationship.  I felt like it would be less risky.  Since this is my very first relationship, chances are, things aren’t going to work out.  And if things don’t work out, he and I said that we could still be friends.”

“But giving it your all in a relationship is part of being in a committed relationship.  You have to be willing to take a risk.  Otherwise, you won’t get as much out of the relationship.  Personally, I don’t want you to break up, but that’s between you and Bryce.  What do you want in a relationship?”

“Hm, that’s a good question,” I said.  I had always wanted a long-term relationship, but now that I had reached that goal, what were my next goals?  “I think I’d want to experience new things and share what I enjoy.  I want to get to know the other person’s interests.”

After some more talk, Gyuna and I left.  But I thought a lot about her question.  I took some time to ponder what I wanted and wrote them down.  I made a list of what came to mind:

```What do I want?```

```I want a LTR.```

```I want someone who helps me want to become a better person.```

```I want someone who feels comfortable around me, even when I'm quiet. I want someone who I feel comfortable talking to.```

```I want someone who is respectful and kind not only to me but to others as well.```

```I want someone who is patient, someone who can empathize with others.```

```I want someone who I can love and care for. I want someone who also loves me and can care for me.```

```I want someone who can help me have fun and still have fun along the way. Someone who doesn't mind planning but also doesn't mind some spontaneity. I want someone who likes to try new things and who will help me try new things too.```

```I want someone who tries to live the gospel and wants it to be part of our lives.```

```I want someone who is intelligent and loves to learn.```

```I want someone who is honest and can tell me how he's feeling.```

```I want someone who is financially secure and responsible.```

```I want someone whom I find physically attractive. I want someone who finds me physically attractive.```

## Section 6

March 16, 2023.  President and Sister Beardall reached out asking if I’d be available to play a musical number for the upcoming mission reunion.  I decided to play the piano version of “Gethsemane” from _The Lamb of God_.  Even though I could’ve played it without narration, I thought it would be fun to have someone narrate.  I asked Gyuna if she could narrate in Korean, so we met at the JSB tonight to rehearse.

We practiced a few times.  “Nothing can replace the cello,” I said.  “The piano version is okay, but the cello sounds way better.”

“You can play so musically though,” Gyuna said.  “Must be nice.”

“The vocal part at the end would be nice to have someone actually singing instead of me just playing it.  Maybe you could sing the melody.”

“Are you kidding me?  You want me to sing that?  I’d be like, ‘LAAAAAAA!’  This song is supposed to be spiritual, but it would turn into a comedy if I were to sing that.”

After a few rounds of practice, Gyuna said she was going to karaoke with some of her Korean friends.  So I was left in the practice room by myself.

I hadn’t seen Bryce for three days.  I hadn’t heard from him since yesterday morning after he told me to text Connor.  I was so torn!  Part of me felt like breaking up would’ve been the right thing to do.  After all, he and I would still be friends, so it wasn’t like either of us were going to lose much.  But part of me also wanted to keep the relationship going because I liked where it was going.  But Connor had told me he was interested in me.

I took time to sketch out the pros and cons.  I felt like the same thoughts were recurring in my head, and I needed to put them on paper.

```Keeping my relationship:```

```Pros:```

```I have an emotionally mature boyfriend.```

```I have someone who really loves me and who wants me to be happy.```

```I enjoy getting taken home.```

```Bryce feels comfortable around me.```

```There aren't any major relationship issues (except that I have feelings for someone else as well).```

.

```Cons:```

```I won't love Bryce as much as he loves me. He feels like a friend mostly, even though I've found him more and more attractive as time has passed.```

```I still have feelings for someone else that I've been trying to let go of for over a month now.```

```He doesn't want to be with someone who constantly thinks about someone else.```

.

```Not keeping my relationship:```

```Pros:```

```I can go after the person I have feelings for.```

```Connor says he's also interested in going on a date with me.```

```I might be in a relationship where I can love someone with all my heart.```

.

```Cons:```

```A LTR may not happen.```

```Connor might not end up being interested, and then I'll truly feel heartbroken. That's already happened once.```

```Not sure how emotionally mature he is...```

```I'll break Bryce’s heart, and I'll feel like a terrible person for who knows how long.```

```I might find out that Connor won't be right for me.```

```Gyuna and Christian will probably not be supportive if I end up dating Connor again.```

```If things don't work out with Connor, then he'll probably revert back to being a mysterious, online person again. And Bryce probably won't want to date anyone for a long time. I can't just try Connor and then think that I can go back to Bryce. I don't want to treat Bryce like he's my insurance.```

```Even though Bryce and I say that we want to be friends if things don't work out, I'm not sure how he'd feel being around Connor if it ever gets to that point.```

I didn’t know how to make this decision.  I was leaning more towards breaking up.  I really was.  And it hurt.  I cried a few times about it.  But I felt it was best for both Bryce and me.  I didn’t want to keep hurting him for not having feelings for him like I did.  He didn’t deserve someone who didn’t love him with all his heart.  He also expressed concerns that made him feel like things might not work out.  Plus, he said he didn't want to be with someone who was constantly thinking about someone else.

In some ways, I felt stupid for being so vulnerable with Connor.  After telling him that I had feelings for him, I wasn’t sure if they were as strong as they were before I told him.  Maybe I just needed to tell him to relieve some tension.  But I also did have feelings for him and wanted to see if things would work out.  And deep down inside, I really DID hope things would work out between Connor and me.

Bryce knew that he still had feelings for me, and Connor expressed interest in going on a date with me, so now it was up to me to make a decision.  Everyone was waiting for me!  It was absolutely stressful.  I just wished there was a way for everyone to be happy!  Maybe date both of them at the same time?  No.  Bryce and Connor wouldn't like that at all.  I just needed to hear Connor say no to a date!  But he didn't say no, and that was what I needed to know.  I didn’t even know if things were going to work out between Connor and me, in which case that would absolutely suck.  If it had been Connor that had broken up with me instead of Bryce, that probably would've left me extremely heartbroken—the kind of physical pain that Bryce had felt himself.  I didn’t feel that way when I thought Bryce and I had broken up.  But if things didn’t work out with Connor, I’d start all over on ground zero, and I didn’t feel like there was anyone else out there for me.  I felt pretty hopeless about it.  Connor told me that he didn’t want to be the reason for a breakup, which was understandable.  It would’ve sounded awful to say that I broke up with Bryce just because I wanted to go on a date with Connor.  It might even end up being my last date with him for good.

It was such a difficult decision.  I really wanted to be friends with Bryce because he was a great guy, but I didn’t know if he’d feel the same way about me, especially after expressing that he had feelings for me.  I still had some feelings for him too, but I felt like there was more potential for me to love, especially seeing how much he loved me.  It even went back to when he and I first started dating.  I felt like he was a really good friend.  And he even admitted that too.  Setting expectations about what it would look like to be friends was something I felt we needed to do.  Now I understood why people who broke up were extremely sad themselves.

I also began to understand why it was so hard for Gyuna and Christian to break up.  It would’ve hurt a lot.  In the moment, the risk of breaking up didn’t seem worth it, even if a better fit for both of them were out there.  Observing Gyuna and Christian’s relationship, I didn’t want to continue stretching the rubber band with Bryce.  I felt like it would’ve been better to snap the rubber band now than later down the road.

So that was my decision.  I was going to break up.  Even though Bryce and I would have the title of “ex,” it didn’t mean it was a negative thing.  He and I would still do things together and be friends.  I planned on letting him know my decision, express gratitude for the relationship, and ask what our expectations would be being friends.

## Section 7

March 18, 2023.  Bryce texted me asking how I was doing.  After some text conversation, he said he’d rather meet today than tomorrow, so I told him to meet me in one of the rooms of the library later in the afternoon to talk about my decision.

"You got me out of bed to come here," he said when he arrived.

"You just woke up?" I asked.

"Well, I do homework in bed since it's Saturday."

I decided to go straight to business.  "So, I texted Connor, and long story short, he told me that he's interested in going on a date with me.  And... I feel like I can't give my all in this relationship with that knowledge."

"I don't think I would've continued this relationship if you were thinking about someone else and you thought I was your number 2."

"Really?" I was surprised that he seemed more on board with this considering that he had told me that he had feelings for me.  "This was a really tough decision for me.  I mean, it might just be one date with him."

"Yeah.  Well, good luck," Bryce said.  I guess I shouldn't have said something like that to him.

"Well... What about being friends?  What kinds of expectations should we set?"

There was about a 10-second pause before he spoke.  "I think being friends would be too hard.  I don't think I'd want to see you that much."

I was a bit devastated—so much so that I didn’t ask him why he felt that way.  He and I had talked about being friends if things didn’t work out.  He even talked about it earlier in the week.  But I guess I could see how that would be really difficult, especially if I wanted to focus on Connor.

"Really?" I didn't know what to say.

"I mean, if we see each other, we can say hi and stuff."

I still wanted to express my gratitude and the things I had learned from him.  "I've reflected on this relationship, and I know I've said this before, but I love your honesty, your loyalty, and your love and care for me.  And as far as becoming a better person, I want to love and care for someone with all my heart, but I feel like I can't do that with you."

"I'm sorry I'm not the one for you."

"No...  I'M sorry..."  Maybe things were a bit too quick.  Even though both of us agreed to try a relationship, it probably would’ve been better to hold off.

There was another pause.  "Well," Bryce said as he put on his backpack.  "Say hi to Gyuna for me.  And good luck with everything.” 

And with that, he walked out.  That was the last time I saw him.  He was another Death of a Steppingstone.

In the song “The Flavor of Life” from the Japanese drama _Hana Yori Dango_, the lyrics of the first line translates somewhat as, “When you say thank you, something sounds a bit off.”  I never understood what those lyrics meant until this moment.  Instead of “thank you,” it was when Bryce told me “good luck.”  I didn’t feel like he actually wanted the best for me in this situation.  Honestly, I didn't expect that we wouldn't be friends.  Bryce was now my ex.  Such a label shouldn't have been bad, but unfortunately, I guess Bryce’s feelings were so strong that a friendship would only bring hurt.  I was really, really sad.

…

I went to Gyuna's place about an hour later.  Christian was also there.  "So did you and Bryce break up?" Gyuna asked.  It was just a painful silence that let her know that it happened.  "Oh my gosh!  You broke up!"

I nodded.

"Wait, what happened?" Christian asked.

“I’m listening too,” Aubree shouted from the back room.

So I explained it all from that Sunday night.

"Has your mindset shifted after being in this relationship?" Christian asked.

"I still want a long-term relationship," I answered.  "It’s something I’ve realized I want.  Honestly, I feel like I had a positive experience being in a relationship with Bryce.  It just didn’t work out.  I think I'm going to give myself time to heal.  I know it took me a couple weeks for me to get over Kent, and I didn't think I'd ever get over him.  I guess I'll see how long it'll take for me to get over this one."

“What are you going to do with the time you have now?”

“What do you mean?”

“I think you’ll have a lot more free time now that you’re not in a relationship anymore,” Christian said.  “Usually people take up a hobby to heal from heartbreak.  You know, maybe pick up a musical instrument or learn photography or something like that.”

“I think I’d hang out with Gyuna like last semester.  And try to make new friends.  I need to do better about that.”

“Will I ever get to see Bryce again?” Gyuna asked.

“I don’t think so,” I answered.

“Dang.  I don’t even have his number.”

The four of us went to an Asian market and then went to Asa Ramen.  We also sang a bunch of karaoke songs, mostly about romance and breakups.

By the time we finished karaoke, it was past midnight.  "Usually Bryce is asleep at this point," I said.  "I wonder if he's sleeping well."

"You still care about him, see?" Gyuna said.  "It'll be okay though.  You'll be able to move on."

"What if I were to go back to someone I had dated before?"

"Mm, no, don't.  Especially Connor.  He just wants to have sex with you."

"I don't think so.  What if he and I were studying at the library?  Would you join?"

"Probably not.  But if I do and you end up going to the bathroom or something, I'll say to him, 'If you even touch him, I'll kill you.'"

Well, I knew how Gyuna really felt about him, so maybe it would be better not to talk about him with her.  I’d have to figure this one out on my own and be willing to take a risk.

On the car ride home, I listened to the song that Bryce told me he thought about during that deep conversation on Sunday—"Let Her Go.”  It seemed like my first relationship ended just as fast as it began.  I wondered that whole night how Bryce was doing—our first night of our breakup.  I honestly hoped he was doing well, and I really was grateful for everything he gave and contributed.
