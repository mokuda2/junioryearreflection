## Introduction

In my [previous post](https://mokuda2.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/26/eda.html), I did exploratory data analysis to figure out which Pokémon would be the strongest to train.  In this blog post, I will share the story that the data is telling and the high-level takeaways.

## Conclusion

One thing I would have done to elaborate on this analysis is to include the type of the Pokémon.  A [type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type#:~:text=Types%20%28Japanese%3A%20%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%97%20Type%29%20are%20properties%20applied%20to,I%2C%20types%20were%20occasionally%20referred%20to%20as%20elements.) is a property that Pokémon have as well as moves in battle.  Examples of types include fire, water, and grass, and some Pokémon may have two types.  A well-rounded Pokémon party includes a variety of types not only of the Pokémon themselves but also their moves.
