My reflection's audience is primarily my family, so I've kept them in mind as I've written this.

_Passages in italics are flashbacks._  They typically are copy-and-paste passages from previous reflections, but I've also written some flashbacks to my mission.  The first chapter has a lot of flashback reading to help build context for the rest of my reflection.  The first two chapters may seem a bit slow, as they set the foundation of my reflection, but I promise that I've made sure that everything I write about is relevant by the end of the reflection.

<u>Passages that are underlined are particular parts of my reflection that I feel are extremely important and relevant to understanding my reflection.</u>  Hopefully it'll help guide you in understanding what I feel is the purpose of this reflection.

<span style="color:red">Words or phrases in red are important concepts or people to keep in mind while reading.</span> 
I hope this will also help with relevance and purpose in my reflection.
